# Configure your tools settings

Users of Visual Studio can export and import different settings like their favorite color theme
allowing them to reuse these settings on different instances and machines. Settings affecting plugins however 
cannot be cross-shared. Sharper Crypto-API Analysis establishes a git-based configuration feature that 
allows storing settings but also 3rd party extensions on any git repository. The plugin can connect to that repository,
pulls and applies all settings.


## Connecting to a git repository. 

Connecting to such a git repository you need to open the plugin's tool window and enter the address of the
repository you'd like to get your settings from. After that press connect.
